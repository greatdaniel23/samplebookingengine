### **Package Image Display Issue Resolved** ✅ (November 12, 2025)
6. **Package Card Images Not Displaying on Step 1**
   - **Issue**: Package cards on step 1 booking page showed no images despite admin setting image URLs
   - **Root Causes**: 
     - Data structure mismatch: `PackageCard.tsx` expected `pkg.image_url` but API returned `pkg.images` array
     - Admin dashboard stored URLs as `image_url` but database used `images` JSON field
     - API endpoints missing `images` field handling in POST/PUT operations
     - Empty images arrays in all packages
   - **Solutions Implemented**:

   - **Result**: Package cards now display images correctly on step 1 booking page
   - **Testing**: Verified functional on development server - all packages show appropriate images

### **Package Details Navigation Error Resolved** ✅ (November 12, 2025)
7. **PackageDetails.tsx TypeError on Field Access**
   - **Issue**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'charAt')` error when accessing package details
   - **Root Causes**: 
     - API returns `type` field but components expected `package_type` field
     - Missing null safety for field access operations
     - Package service functions not handling API data format
   - **Solutions Implemented**:
     - **Field Mapping Fix**: Updated `PackageDetails.tsx` to use `pkg.type || pkg.package_type` with null safety
     - **Service Enhancement**: Enhanced `packageService.getPackageTypeColor()` to handle both API and legacy formats
     - **Display Name Fix**: Updated `packageService.getPackageTypeDisplayName()` with proper type mappings

   - **Root Causes**: 
     - `pkg.room_options` field accessed without null checks (field doesn't exist in API)
     - Package type filtering using `pkg.package_type` instead of `pkg.type` in Packages.tsx
     - Missing null safety for undefined API fields
   - **Solutions Implemented**:
     - **Room Options Fix**: Added null safety for `pkg.room_options && pkg.room_options.length > 0`
     - **Array Access Fix**: Updated `pkg.room_options.map()` to `(pkg.room_options || []).map()`
     - **Type Filter Fix**: Updated Packages.tsx filter to use `(pkg.type || pkg.package_type) === filters.type`
     - **Consistent Field Mapping**: Applied same field mapping pattern across all components
   - **Files Updated**:
     - `src/pages/PackageDetails.tsx` - Added null safety for room_options field access
     - `src/pages/Packages.tsx` - Fixed package type filtering to use correct field name

   - **Testing**: Verified `/packages` shows package list, all individual package detail pages load correctly

### **Package Images Loading Issues Resolved** ✅ (November 12, 2025)
9. **Package Images Not Loading on Packages Page and Package Details**
   - **Issue**: Package images not displaying on `/packages` listing page and missing src attribute on package detail pages
   - **Root Causes**: 
     - Inconsistent image URL formats in database - some packages had full URLs, others had empty image arrays
     - `PackageDetails.tsx` using `pkg.image_url` field which doesn't exist in API response (API returns `images` array)
   - **Investigation**: 
     - API response revealed inconsistent image data across 5 packages
     - Package detail page HTML showed `<img>` tag with missing `src` attribute
     - `PackageCard.tsx` had proper `getPackageImageUrl()` function but `PackageDetails.tsx` did not
   - **Solutions Implemented**:
     - **Database Fix**: Updated all 5 packages with consistent relative image URLs via API PUT requests:
       - Package 1: `/images/packages/romantic-escape.jpg`
       - Package 2: `/images/packages/business-elite.jpg`
       - Package 3: `/images/packages/business-elite.jpg`
       - Package 4: `/images/packages/romantic-escape.jpg`
       - Package 5: `/images/packages/business-elite.jpg`
     - **PackageDetails Fix**: Added `getPackageImageUrl()` function to `PackageDetails.tsx` with same logic as `PackageCard.tsx`
     - **Image Source Fix**: Changed `src={pkg.image_url}` to `src={getPackageImageUrl()}` in PackageDetails component
   - **Files Updated**: 
     - Database records via API PUT operations (`api/packages.php`)
     - `src/pages/PackageDetails.tsx` - Added proper image URL resolution
   - **Result**: Both packages listing page and individual package detail pages now display images correctly
   - **Testing**: Verified `/packages` shows all images and `/packages/1` displays proper image with src attribute

### **Packages Page API and UI Component Errors Resolved** ✅ (November 12, 2025)
10. **Packages Page Blank with Database and UI Component Errors**
   - **Issue**: Packages page showing blank with two critical errors:
     - Database Error: `Unknown column 'package_type' in 'field list'`
     - UI Error: `A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string`
   - **Root Causes**: 
     - Missing API endpoint: `getPackageTypes()` function calling non-existent `/packages?action=types` endpoint
     - Invalid SelectItem value: Package type filter dropdown using `value=""` which is not allowed in Radix UI Select component
   - **Investigation**: 
     - `packageService.getPackageTypes()` calling `/packages?action=types` but this endpoint wasn't implemented in `api/packages.php`
     - `Packages.tsx` had `<SelectItem value="">All types</SelectItem>` causing React/Radix UI error
     - Database query error originated from missing endpoint, not actual column issues
   - **Solutions Implemented**:
     - **API Endpoint Fix**: Added `action=types` support in `api/packages.php` with query: `SELECT type as package_type, COUNT(*) as count FROM packages GROUP BY type ORDER BY type`
     - **Service Fix**: Corrected endpoint URL from `/packages?action=types` to `/packages.php?action=types` in `packageService.ts`
     - **UI Component Fix**: Changed `<SelectItem value="">All types</SelectItem>` to `<SelectItem value="all">All types</SelectItem>`
     - **Filter Logic Fix**: Updated filter logic to handle `filters.type !== 'all'` instead of empty string check
   - **Files Updated**: 
     - `api/packages.php` - Added package types endpoint with GROUP BY query
     - `src/services/packageService.ts` - Fixed endpoint URL 
     - `src/pages/Packages.tsx` - Fixed SelectItem value and filter logic
   - **Result**: Packages page now loads correctly with functional type filtering dropdown and proper API data
   - **Testing**: Verified `/packages` loads package list, dropdown shows "Adventure (1), Romance (1), Wellness (1)" with working filters

### **PackageCard Room Options Null Safety Issue Resolved** ✅ (November 12, 2025)  
11. **PackageCard Component Runtime Error**
   - **Issue**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` error in `PackageCard.tsx` at line 149
   - **Root Cause**: `pkg.room_options` field accessed without null safety checks - same pattern as previously fixed in `PackageDetails.tsx`
   - **Investigation**: 
     - Error occurred when `showRoomOptions` prop was true but `pkg.room_options` was undefined
     - Multiple unsafe accesses to `room_options.length` without null checks
     - API doesn't provide `room_options` field for packages, causing undefined access
   - **Solutions Implemented**:
     - **Null Safety Fix**: Added `pkg.room_options &&` check before accessing length property
     - **Array Safety Fix**: Changed `pkg.room_options.slice(0, 2).map()` to `(pkg.room_options || []).slice(0, 2).map()`
     - **Additional Safety**: Added null check for "more room types" display logic  
   - **Files Updated**: `src/components/PackageCard.tsx` - Added comprehensive null safety for room_options field access
   - **Result**: PackageCard components now render without runtime errors, gracefully handle missing room_options data
   - **Testing**: Verified packages page loads without console errors, package cards display correctly

### **Booking Page Package Image Display Issue Resolved** ✅ (November 13, 2025)
12. **Package Images Not Showing on /book?package=1 Path**
   - **Issue**: Package images not displaying on booking page (`/book?package=1`) - image src was empty
   - **Root Cause**: `Booking.tsx` using `selectedPackage.image_url` but packages use `images` array field  
   - **Investigation**: 
     - API returns `"images":["http://localhost/.../DSC02126.JPG"]` array format
     - Other components like `PackageCard.tsx` already had proper `getPackageImageUrl()` function
     - `Booking.tsx` was missing the image array handling logic
   - **Solutions Implemented**:
     - **Image URL Function**: Added `getPackageImageUrl()` function to `Booking.tsx` with same logic as `PackageCard.tsx`
     - **Array Handling**: Function handles `pkg.images` array, falls back to `pkg.image_url`, then to type-based defaults
     - **Consistent Logic**: Applied same image resolution pattern used successfully in other components
     - **Fallback System**: Added type-based default images and placeholder handling
   - **Files Updated**: 
     - `src/pages/Booking.tsx` - Added `getPackageImageUrl()` function and updated image src
   - **Result**: Package images now display correctly on booking page (`/book?package=1`)
   - **Testing**: Verified booking page shows package image from `images` array field

### **Summary Page Package Image Display Issue Resolved** ✅ (November 13, 2025)
13. **Package Images Not Showing on /summary Path**
   - **Issue**: Package images not displaying on booking summary page (`/summary?ref=BK-xxx&package=1`) - same issue as booking page
   - **Root Cause**: `BookingSummary.tsx` using `packageData.image_url` but packages use `images` array field
   - **Investigation**: 
     - Same pattern as booking page - using deprecated `image_url` field instead of `images` array
     - Component needed consistent image handling logic with other package components
   - **Solutions Implemented**:
     - **Image URL Function**: Added `getPackageImageUrl()` function to `BookingSummary.tsx` with same logic as other components
     - **Array Handling**: Function handles `pkg.images` array, falls back to `pkg.image_url`, then to type-based defaults
     - **Consistent Logic**: Applied same image resolution pattern across all package components
   - **Files Updated**: 
     - `src/pages/BookingSummary.tsx` - Added `getPackageImageUrl()` function and updated image src from `packageData.image_url` to `getPackageImageUrl(packageData)`
   - **Result**: Package images now display correctly on booking summary page
   - **Testing**: Verified summary page shows package image with real booking reference `BK-299163`

### **Email Emoji Character Encoding Issue Resolved** ✅ (November 13, 2025)
14. **Corrupted Emoji Characters in Email ("ЁЯПи", "ðŸŽ‰")**
   - **Issue**: Emojis appearing as corrupted characters in sent emails - "🎉" showing as "ðŸŽ‰" and "🏨" showing as "ЁЯПи"
   - **Root Cause**: Missing UTF-8 character encoding specification in PHPMailer configuration
   - **Investigation**: 
     - Emojis in source files (`email-service.php`, `email-templates/*.html`, `email-templates/*.txt`) were correct
     - HTML templates had proper `<meta charset="UTF-8">` declarations
     - PHPMailer was missing `CharSet` and `Encoding` properties
     - Email clients were not properly interpreting the character encoding
   - **Solutions Implemented**:
     - **Character Set Fix**: Added `$mail->CharSet = 'UTF-8';` to PHPMailer configuration
     - **Encoding Method**: Added `$mail->Encoding = 'base64';` for reliable character transmission
     - **Email Header Fix**: Ensures proper UTF-8 encoding in email headers and body
   - **Files Updated**: 
     - `email-service.php` - Added UTF-8 charset and base64 encoding to PHPMailer configuration
   - **Result**: Emojis now display correctly in both HTML and text emails (🎉, 🏨, 🔔)
   - **Testing**: Verified with `test_booking` action - emails display proper emojis instead of corrupted characters
   - **Email Locations**: 
     - Guest confirmation email subject: "🎉 Booking Confirmation"
     - Admin notification subject: "🔔 NEW BOOKING ALERT"
     - Email body content: "🏨 Villa Daisy Cantik" displays correctly

### **Admin Dashboard URL Configuration Issue Identified** ⚠️ (November 13, 2025)
15. **Admin Dashboard Calling Wrong API URL on Production**
   - **Issue**: Admin dashboard making API calls to `https://booking.rumahdaisycantik.com/api/villa.php` (404 error)
   - **Correct URL**: `https://api.rumahdaisycantik.com/villa.php` (working - Status 200 OK)
   - **Root Cause**: Fallback URL logic in admin-dashboard.html: `const apiUrl = window.getApiUrl ? window.getApiUrl('villa.php') : '/api/villa.php';`
   - **Investigation**: 
     - API endpoint is working: `https://api.rumahdaisycantik.com/villa.php` returns proper JSON response
     - config.js is loaded correctly with `PRODUCTION_BASE_URL: 'https://api.rumahdaisycantik.com'`
     - Problem is fallback URL `/api/villa.php` being used instead of config.js function
     - Browser shows: "Request URL: https://booking.rumahdaisycantik.com/api/villa.php" (404 Not Found)
   - **Solutions Implemented**:
     - **Removed Fallback URLs**: Eliminated problematic fallback `/api/villa.php` in all villa API calls
     - **Added Configuration Validation**: Added checks to ensure config.js loads before making API calls
     - **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added clear error messages if config.js fails to load
     - **Added Debug Logging**: Console logs show exactly which URL is being called
   - **Files Updated**: 
     - `admin-dashboard.html` - Fixed all villa.php API calls in Business Details and Villa Info sections
     - Added configuration validation and debug logging
   - **Status**: ⚠️ **NEEDS UPLOAD** - Updated admin-dashboard.html needs to be uploaded to production
   - **Testing Required**: After upload, verify admin dashboard calls correct API URL
