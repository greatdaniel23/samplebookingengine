## 2025-01-25 - Critical Auth Bypass in Admin Endpoints
**Vulnerability:** Admin and Settings endpoints (`/api/admin/*`, `/api/settings/*`) were completely unauthenticated. Anyone could access revenue stats and change global settings.
**Learning:** The `handleAuth` function existed but was not being used by other handlers. It seems like the auth implementation was "in progress" (`TODO` comments) and left wide open.
**Prevention:** Always implement a "deny by default" middleware or ensure every sensitive route handler starts with an authentication check.

## 2025-05-20 - Unauthenticated Booking Manipulation (IDOR)
**Vulnerability:** The `PUT /api/bookings/:id/status` and `GET /api/bookings/:id` endpoints were completely unauthenticated. Attackers could view any booking by ID or change its status (e.g., to "confirmed" or "paid") without credentials.
**Learning:** `handleBookings` had auth checks for the *list* endpoint but missed them for specific ID operations. Copy-paste errors or partial implementation often lead to these gaps.
**Prevention:** Use a middleware pattern or a router library that enforces auth at the route group level, rather than manual checks inside every `if` block.
