## 2025-01-26 - Critical Missing Auth in Catalog Management
**Vulnerability:** Several administrative endpoints (`/api/amenities`, `/api/inclusions`, `/api/gtm`, `/api/images`) allowed state-changing operations (POST, PUT, DELETE) without any authentication.
**Learning:** Checking auth in the main dispatcher or route handler is crucial. It seems new handlers were added without copying the auth pattern from existing ones like `handleAdmin`.
**Prevention:** Ensure all new route handlers that modify data accept `request` and perform an auth check at the very beginning. Consider a middleware pattern or a wrapper function for protected routes to enforce this automatically.

## 2025-01-25 - Critical Auth Bypass in Admin Endpoints
**Vulnerability:** Admin and Settings endpoints (`/api/admin/*`, `/api/settings/*`) were completely unauthenticated. Anyone could access revenue stats and change global settings.
**Learning:** The `handleAuth` function existed but was not being used by other handlers. It seems like the auth implementation was "in progress" (`TODO` comments) and left wide open.
**Prevention:** Always implement a "deny by default" middleware or ensure every sensitive route handler starts with an authentication check.
